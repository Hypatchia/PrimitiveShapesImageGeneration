## Geometric Shape Generation and Classification


* Welcome to my Geometric Shape Generation and Classification project repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my work for the generation, classification, and analysis of geometric shapes.

## Projects:
* **GeometricShapeGenerationDataset.ipynb**:
This Jupyter notebook focuses on the generation of various geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, and more. It provides a detailed dataset for these shapes, which can be invaluable for training deep learning models and Convolutional Neural Networks
* **GeometricShapesGeneration_ClassificationCNN.ipynb** In this notebook,The generated geometric shapes dataset was taken and I build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Multiclass classification. It demonstrates the entire process from shape generation to model training and evaluation.

* **MultiShapeImagesDatasetGeneration.ipynb** is an other Jupyter notebook dedicated to generating datasets but with a focus on creating more complex, multi-shape images. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require a more diverse dataset.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the Jupyter notebooks using your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).
* Follow the instructions  (In comments) within each notebook to generate, classify, and analyze geometric shapes.
