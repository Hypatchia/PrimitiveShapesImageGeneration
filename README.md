## Geometric Shape Generation and Classification

* Welcome to my Geometric Shape Generation and Classification project repository! 
* This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my work for the generation, classification, and analysis of geometric shapes. 

The project focuses on three main aspects: Shape Generation, Classification, and Multi-Shape Image Dataset Generation.
### Shape Generation:
**Purpose**

The Shape Generation section is dedicated to programmatically creating various shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles. The primary goal is to build a diverse dataset for training machine learning models.

**Significance**
  
**Dataset Customization:** Programmatically generating shapes allows for the customization of the dataset, catering to specific needs in machine learning applications.

**Labeled Data:** The created shapes serve as labeled data, facilitating the training of computers to recognize and understand geometric patterns.

### Classification:
After making shapes, the project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify them into categories. This shows how we can train computers to recognize and sort geometric shapes effectively. The classification part is not just about shapes; it's like a basic building block for more complex tasks in computer vision. Understanding how to identify shapes is crucial for real-world applications where machines need to recognize shapes automatically.

**Purpose**
  
Following the Shape Generation phase, the project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the generated shapes into distinct categories.

**Importance**
  
**Basic Building Block for Computer Vision:** Classification serves as a fundamental step in computer vision, acting as a building block for more complex tasks.
**Real-world Applications:** The ability to identify shapes is crucial for real-world applications where machines need to automatically recognize and categorize objects based on their geometric properties.

* **Multi-Shape Image Dataset Generation:**
The project doesn't stop at single shapes. It combines different shapes into one image, making things more complex. This is like creating images that look like real-world scenes where you have more than one thing going on. This step is especially useful for tasks like image segmentation, where the computer needs to figure out and label different objects within a single image. Mixing shapes in one image makes the training data richer, helping the computer to handle a variety of situations better.


**Application**

**Richer Training Data:** Mixing shapes in one image enhances the richness of the training data, preparing the computer to handle diverse and complex situations.
**Image Segmentation:** Multi-shape images contribute to tasks such as image segmentation, where the computer must identify and label different objects within a single image.

## Projects:
* **GeometricShapeGenerationDataset.ipynb**:
This Jupyter notebook focuses on the generation of various geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, and more. It provides a detailed dataset for these shapes, which can be invaluable for training deep learning models and Convolutional Neural Networks
* **GeometricShapesGeneration_ClassificationCNN.ipynb** In this notebook,The generated geometric shapes dataset was taken and I build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Multiclass classification. It demonstrates the entire process from shape generation to model training and evaluation.

* **MultiShapeImagesDatasetGeneration.ipynb** is an other Jupyter notebook dedicated to generating datasets but with a focus on creating more complex, multi-shape images. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require a more diverse dataset.
